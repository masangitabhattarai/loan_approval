# Loan Approval Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan will be approved or rejected using historical loan application data. The final model is **Logistic Regression**, chosen for its high accuracy (78.86%) and interpretability. The model is deployed using **Streamlit** to provide a simple, interactive interface for real-time predictions.

## Features
- Real-time loan approval predictions.
- Interactive Streamlit app for user input.
- Uses applicant and co-applicant income, credit history, education, marital status, employment, loan amount, and property area as input features.
- Provides interpretable results based on Logistic Regression.

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash

git clone https://github.com/masangitabhattarai/loan_approval.git
cd loan_approval
```

2. **Run Streamlit App**

streamlit run app.py
